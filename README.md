<H2>Should this call centre adjust staffing levels to meet anticipated call demand?</H2>
This project aims to analyze call center data accumulated from 01/01/2021 to 31/03/2021. Analyzing entries such as total calls, call duration, and satisfaction ratings can help gain valuable insights into customer behavior, agent performance, and overall contact center effectiveness. The data was cleaned, manipulated, analyzed, and visualized using Power BI

<H2>The Dataset</H2>

<ul>
<li>5000 total entries across 10 columns</li>
<li>These columns include call ID, agent name, date, time, topic, Answered (Y/N), resolved, speed of answer in seconds, avgTalkDuration, and satisfaction rating</li>
<li>8 agents are working between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m.</li>
<li>Blank entries in speed of answer in seconds, avgTalkDuration, and satisfaction rating have been assigned 0 because they are for abandoned calls</li> </ul>

The following questions can be answered from the available data:
<H2>Customer Experience: What is the customer satisfaction rate?</H2>

<H2>Agent Performance: How many calls were handled, and how does the average handling time vary among agents?</H2>

<H2>Operational Efficiency: Are there patterns or trends in call volume based on time of day, day of the week?</H2>

<H2>Overall Call Center Performance Recommendations</H2>
<ul>
<li><b>Optimize Speed of Answer:</b> The current average speed is 67.5 seconds. Implementing better call routing and perhaps increasing staffing could resolve this problem.</li> 

<li><b>Enhance First Call Resolution (FCR):</b> Track and aim to improve the number of calls resolved on the first contact. Training agents on problem-solving and providing more resources can help.</li>

<li><b>Improve Customer Satisfaction:</b> The current average rating is 3 out of 5. The aim is for a satisfaction rating of 4 or higher by enhancing agent training, improving call scripts, and providing agents with more authority to resolve issues.</li>

<li><b>Reduce Talk Time:</b> The current average call duration is 20 minutes which is significantly high. Ensure agents are focused on resolving issues quickly without compromising quality.</li>

<li><b>Monitor Call Volume and Trends:</b> Call volume seems to be high throughout the day. Increasing staff could increase efficiency.</li>

<li><b>Implement Feedback Loops:</b> Regularly collect feedback from customers and agents to identify pain points and areas for improvement. Use this feedback to continuously refine processes and training programs.</li>

<li><b>Leverage Technology:</b> Utilize advanced call center technologies like AI-driven call routing, and chatbots for basic inquiries.</li> </ul>

This project aims to analyze a call center dataset. The data was cleaned, manipulated, analysed, and visualized using Power BI
Key Dataset Features:
Call ID: Unique identifier for each call.
Agent: Information about the handling agent.
Date and Time: Timestamps for each call.
Topic: Categorization of calls based on the conversation subject.
Answered (Y/N): Indicates if the call was answered.
Resolved: Indicates if the call was successfully resolved.
Speed of Answer: Time is taken for a call to be answered.
Avg Talk Duration: Average duration of each call.
Satisfaction Rating: Customer feedback on satisfaction.

Using Power BI's extensive range of visualizations and analytical capabilities, we will create dynamic reports and dashboards to explore the dataset and uncover key call center trends and insights. The analysis will include:

Call Volume and Distribution: Analyzing the number of calls received over time, identifying peak hours or days, and examining the distribution of calls across different topics.
Average handle time: This metric tells how long it takes the agents to handle each call. 
Call Center Performance: Evaluating metrics such as speed of answer, average talk duration, and resolution rates to assess call center efficiency and identify opportunities for improvement.
Customer satisfaction: This metric tells how satisfied the customers are with the call center service.
Reason Analysis: Explore the most common reasons for customer inquiries, helping prioritize areas for improvement.

Power BI's interactive visualizations will enable drill-down analysis and the ability to slice and dice the data based on various dimensions such as date, topic, agent, and satisfaction rating. This will empower call center managers and stakeholders to make data-driven decisions, optimize operations, and enhance customer service.


Overall Call Center Performance Recommendations:

Optimize Speed of Answer:Current Average: 67.5 secondsGoal: Aim to reduce this by implementing better call routing and perhaps increasing staffing during peak times.

Enhance First Call Resolution (FCR):Resolution Rate: Track and aim to improve the number of calls resolved on the first contact. Training agents on problem-solving and providing more resources can help.

Improve Customer Satisfaction:Current Average Rating: 3.4 out of 5Goal: Aim for a satisfaction rating of 4 or higher by enhancing agent training, improving call scripts, and providing agents with more authority to resolve issues.

Reduce Talk Time:Current Average: 24.9 secondsGoal: While not significantly high, optimizing this can lead to more efficient call handling. Ensure agents are focused on resolving issues quickly without compromising quality.

Monitor Call Volume and Trends:Analyze call volume patterns to ensure adequate staffing during peak times and identify common issues that can be proactively addressed.

Implement Feedback Loops:Regularly collect feedback from customers and agents to identify pain points and areas for improvement. Use this feedback to continuously refine processes and training programs.

Leverage Technology:Utilize advanced call center technologies like AI-driven call routing, chatbots for basic inquiries, and detailed analytics to monitor performance metrics in real-time.

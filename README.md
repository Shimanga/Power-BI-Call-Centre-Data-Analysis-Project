This project aims to analyze call center data extracted from 01/01/2021 to 31/03/2021. 01/01/2021-31/03/2021. Analyzing entries such as total calls, call duration, and satisfaction ratings can help gain valuable insights into customer behavior, agent performance, and overall contact center effectiveness. The data was cleaned, manipulated, analyzed, and visualized using Power BI

The Dataset

5000 total entries across 10 columns
These columns include call ID, agent name, date, time, topic, Answered (Y/N), resolved, speed of answer in seconds, avgTalkDuration, and satisfaction rating
8 agents are working between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m.
Blank entries in speed of answer in seconds, avgTalkDuration, and satisfaction rating have been assigned 0 because they are for abandoned calls

Exploring the data

Call Volume and Distribution: Analyzing the number of calls received over time, identifying peak hours or days, and examining the distribution of calls across different topics.
Average handle time: This metric tells how long it takes the agents to handle each call. 
Call Center Performance: Evaluating metrics such as speed of answer, average talk duration, and resolution rates to assess call center efficiency and identify opportunities for improvement.
Customer satisfaction: This metric tells how satisfied the customers are with the call center service.
Reason Analysis: Explore the most common reasons for customer inquiries, helping prioritize areas for improvement.


Overall Call Center Performance Recommendations:

Optimize Speed of Answer: Current Average: 67.5 seconds Goal: Aim to reduce this by implementing better call routing and perhaps increasing staffing during peak times.

Enhance First Call Resolution (FCR):Resolution Rate: Track and aim to improve the number of calls resolved on the first contact. Training agents on problem-solving and providing more resources can help.

Improve Customer Satisfaction:Current Average Rating: 3.4 out of 5Goal: Aim for a satisfaction rating of 4 or higher by enhancing agent training, improving call scripts, and providing agents with more authority to resolve issues.

Reduce Talk Time:Current Average: 24.9 secondsGoal: While not significantly high, optimizing this can lead to more efficient call handling. Ensure agents are focused on resolving issues quickly without compromising quality.

Monitor Call Volume and Trends:Analyze call volume patterns to ensure adequate staffing during peak times and identify common issues that can be proactively addressed.

Implement Feedback Loops:Regularly collect feedback from customers and agents to identify pain points and areas for improvement. Use this feedback to continuously refine processes and training programs.

Leverage Technology:Utilize advanced call center technologies like AI-driven call routing, chatbots for basic inquiries, and detailed analytics to monitor performance metrics in real-time.
